#Grocery Store Data Analysis and Visualization
This project is designed to help grocery store managers understand customer purchasing behavior
by cleaning and processing data collected from store transactions. The program will analyze the
data and display the information in visual graphs, making it easy for managers to interpret trends and patterns.
The insights gained from these visualizations can help predict future customer behavior, 
enabling better inventory management and targeted marketing strategies.
